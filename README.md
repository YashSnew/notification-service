# üì¢ Notification Service
The Notification Service is a production-ready, scalable backend microservice built using Node.js, Express, Kafka, and MongoDB, aimed at handling asynchronous notification workflows in modern distributed systems.
This service provides a RESTful API interface to allow applications or microservices to trigger and retrieve notifications in a decoupled manner using Apache Kafka as the event streaming backbone.
It follows a publisher-subscriber architecture, which enables scalable and fault-tolerant communication between services, ideal for real-time systems, task updates, alerts, or logs.
This project uses Swagger UI to provide interactive API documentation.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup:

Ensure you have the following installed:
-Node.js (v16 or later)
-npm (Node package manager)
-Kafka (Local instance or via Docker)
-MongoDB (Local instance or via Mongo Atlas)
-Docker & Docker Compose (optional but recommended for easier setup

üì¶ Clone the Repository
   -git clone https://github.com/YashSnew/notification-service.git
   -cd notification-service

üì• Install Dependencies

              -npm install

‚öôÔ∏è Configure Environment Variables  
    Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

          
          PORT=3000
          MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notifications
          KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
          KAFKA_TOPIC=notification-events
  
  Make sure MongoDB and Kafka are running at the specified host/port, or update the values accordingly.

üß™ Run MongoDB and Kafka (Docker - Recommended)
   If you don‚Äôt have Kafka or MongoDB installed locally, use Docker:  

           docker-compose up -d
           
  
üöÄ Start the Notification Service  

              -npm start


Expected output:
  MongoDB Connected
 ‚úÖ Kafka Producer connected
 üöÄ Server running on port 3000





 üîÅ API Endpoints

 
‚ûï To Create Notification:
POST /notification
 
 Request Body:
   {
     "userId": "1234567890",
     "type": "info",
     "message": "Your task is completed."
   }


‚û°Ô∏èTo Get All Notifications: 
 GET /notification



üìö API Documentation (Swagger UI): 

      http://localhost:3000/api-docs






üß† Assumptions:
  ‚úÖ Kafka and Zookeeper are running either locally or via Docker as defined in docker-compose.yml.
  ‚úÖ MongoDB is accessible and properly configured in the .env file or running on localhost:27017.
  ‚úÖ Kafka topics are pre-created, or Kafka auto-topic creation is enabled (typically enabled by default).
  ‚úÖ The application runs in a Node.js (v14+) environment with npm installed.
  ‚úÖ This service assumes basic familiarity with Kafka, Express.js, and REST APIs.
  ‚úÖ Kafka broker address and MongoDB URI are correctly set in your environment variables.
  ‚úÖ No authentication or rate limiting has been implemented ‚Äî this is a foundational service that can be extended as needed.
